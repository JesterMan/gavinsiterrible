<!--     <h1>GAVIN ST. OURS</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>IS A  </h2>
    <h3>TERRIBLE PERSON</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>He has so many bad qualities that words describing them they could fill a universe... </p>
    <p>but I'll just list a few.</p>
    <p>He constantly steals office supplies from other people's desks. He is unrepentant about doing so, and shows no signs of stopping. If you are ever missing anything, he probably took it.</p>
    <p>He insists on writing passive aggressive post-it notes and sticking them on people's screens, blocking their view of important work. These notes are petty and mean, reflecting the soul of their author. They insult people with mental disabilities and reference male genitalia in a completely inappropriate manner. Only a true jerk like Gavin St. Ours would write notes like these. </p>
    <p>He intentionally eats food that smells terrible, creating a stink cloud around his desk. Loudly smacking his lips, he draws as much attention as possible to his gross meal. Later, he passes gas that could melt the paint off a stop sign. He jokingly refers to this as the "Afternoon Funk" and pretends it magically comes from the restaurant downstairs. You're not fooling anyone Gavin St. Ours, no restaurant could stay in business if they smelled like your gas. </p>
    <br><br>
    --> <p> Gavin St. Ours is terrible, and should be forced to sit in the corner and think about what he's done.</p>
